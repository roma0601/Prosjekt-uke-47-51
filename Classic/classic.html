          <h2>Classic</h2>
          <p>World of Warcraft Classic is a version of World of Warcraft that players have been longing for for years. Many felt that the patches and updates
          being added to the retail version of the game ruined the core principles that they felt made WoW what it was in the old days, the social aspect of the game.
          The addition of a dungeon and group finding tool, the increase in server population, and many other factors helped ruin this, many felt.
          Thats why, when Blizzard at BlizzCon 2017 announced World of Warcraft Classic, the playerbase rejoiced.</p>
          <p>In World of Warcraft Classic you take a step back from the live version of the game, and step into simpler, yet in some ways more complicated,
            version of the game. Terms like weaponskill, class trainers, talent tree, and a trade chat being spammed with "LFG" and "LFM", may seem foreign to
          many, but you quickly get used to the new dynamic of the Classic experience.</p>
          <p>The game is in many ways slowed down in Classic. The leveling takes longer, killing mobs takes longer, finding groups and completing dungeons
            take longer, pretty much everything takes longer, and to many this is what they like about the game. The game is no longer a rush to complete your daily
            objectives, like retail has becomet to many. </p>

          <h2>Classes</h2>
          <p>In World of Warcraft classic there are both fewer classes and races avaiable than in the Retail version.
          However the classes play out very differently. A completly different weaponsystem, talentsystem and skillsystem make the game completly different from the
          retail version.</p>

              <h2>Raids</h2>
              <p>In World of Warcraft: Classic there is only on raid difficulty avaiable. There is no group finder or LFR so the raid is completed
              with a premade group of up to 40 players. There are currently 3 raids avaiable in Classic, but several more are set to release in later content
              patches. Raids in Classic are generlly easier than raids in Retail, requiering less mechanical skill, but some bosses still require precise
              stretegies and good communication. </p>
              <p>When the raids  were first release many considered them some of the hardest challenges in the game to date,
              the final boss of Molten Core requiering over 5 months to kill, but with the release of classic the raid was cleared within a week.
              There are many reasons for this, but the main reasons are an improved playerbase, more and better resources for reserche and better
              computers and connection to the gameservers. </p>
