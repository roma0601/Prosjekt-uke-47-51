            <h3>Molten Core</h3>
            <p>The Molten Core lies at the very bottom of Blackrock Depths. It is the heart of Blackrock Mountain and the exact spot where, long ago in a desperate bid to turn the tide of the dwarven civil war, Emperor Thaurissan summoned the elemental Firelord, Ragnaros, into the world. Though the firelord is incapable of straying far from the blazing Core, it is believed that his elemental minions command the Dark Iron dwarves, who are in the midst of creating armies out of living stone. The burning lake where Ragnaros lies sleeping acts as a rift connecting to the plane of fire, allowing the malicious elementals to pass through. Chief among Ragnaros' agents is Majordomo Executus - for this cunning elemental is the only one capable of calling the Firelord from his slumber.</p>

            <h3>Onyxias Lair</h3>
            <p>Onyxia is the daughter of the mighty Black Aspect, Deathwing, and sister of the scheming Nefarian, Lord of Blackrock Spire. Whereas her father favors brute force, and her brother creates twisted abominations to carry out his will, Onyxia prefers subtle manipulation, and delights in meddling in the political affairs of mortals, using her charm and power to influence such delicate matters between the different races to her own ends. Some believe that Onyxia has even assumed an alias once used by her father - the title of the royal House Prestor. Most recently, she very nearly succeeded in destroying the political structure of Stormwind in the guise of Katrana Prestor, before being unmasked by Marshal Windsor and fleeing to her lair: a fiery cave below the Dragonmurk, a dismal swamp located within Dustwallow Marsh. There she is guarded by her kin, the remaining members of the insidious black dragonflight.</p>

            <h3>Blackwing Lair</h3>
            <p>In the dark recesses of the mountain's peak, Nefarian, the eldest son of Deathwing, conducts some of his most awful experimentation, controlling mighty beings like puppets and combining the eggs of different dragonflights with horrific results. Should he prove successful, even darker pursuits rest on the horizon.
              And, yet, the Lord of Blackrock is not a mere scientist - he is a great dragon cornered in his lair. Can he truly be defeated by mortal hands?</p>
