          <h1>The second Great War</h1>
          <p>The Second War, also known as the second Great War, was a major conflict that took place in the Eastern Kingdoms
            around four years following the opening of the Dark Portal, between the armies of the Orcish Horde
            and an Alliance of several other races. The conflict immediately succeeded the First War and saw the
            two factions clash for mastery of the entire continent, as well as Azeroth at large.</p>
          <p>After the fall of Stormwind, the new Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer set out to conquer the rest of Azeroth so that the
            orcs would have a new homeworld of their own. He was responsible for instigating a renewed campaign to seize control
            of the other lands to the north, certain that the human kingdoms would avenge themselves if the orcs didn't strike first.
            At the same time Lord Anduin Lothar, the former Champion of Stormwind, led his surviving people across the Great Sea to the shores
            of Lordaeron. He met with King Terenas and warned him of the invasion to come. A meeting with the leaders of the other
            human nations was called and led to the formation of the Alliance of Lordaeron, which would eventually grow to encompass
            almost all of the Eastern Kingdoms' major races, with Lothar as Supreme Allied Commander.</p>
          <p>The Horde led two major assaults. The southern offensive was through the dwarven lands of
            Khaz Modan but after a series of savage battles, Alliance forces pushed the Horde back to the bridges of the Thandol Span.
            The northern offensive came from the Great Sea. Though the Horde achieved early success by using enslaved red dragons
            and almost took the Capital City of Lordaeron after Alterac betrayed its comrades, the war began to turn in favor of the
            Alliance due to a number of factors, most notably the founding of the Knights of the Order of the Silver Hand and the betrayal
            of the orc warlock Gul'dan. Outmaneuvered and outmatched, the Horde was ultimately forced to retreat south to its previous holdings.

          <p>The pursuing Alliance armies caught up and did battle with Doomhammer's forces in the Burning Steppes,
          the outcome of which proved a decisive victory for the Alliance. However, Lothar had fallen in the battle and
          leadership was taken up by his second in command Turalyon.</p>
          <p>The war soon came to an end after the final battle at the Dark Portal which was subsequently destroyed.
            The conflict had raged on for over a year, and had seen the destruction of villages and populations on an unprecedented scale,
            leaving entire kingdoms devastated in its wake. The Alliance would last for many years to follow and lead the nations of Azeroth
            to become more intertwined with each other. Though the Horde found itself thoroughly defeated, the conflict did not secure long-term
            peace on the continent. Two years later, a new war would once again break out, culminating in the Invasion of Draenor.</p>
