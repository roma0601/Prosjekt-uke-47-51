          <h2>Jaina Proudmoore</h2>
          <p>Lady Jaina Proudmoore is the daughter of Daelin and Katherine Proudmoore, and sister of Derek and Tandred.
            She is considered one of the finest mages in all Azeroth and the most powerful human sorceress alive.
            She is the Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras, the former leader of the Kirin Tor of Dalaran, and of the port-city of Theramore.</p>
          <p>Trained as the personal agent of Archmage Antonidas, the late leader of the Kirin Tor and Dalaran,
            she was sent to investigate the plague of undeath with Prince Arthas Menethil, her childhood friend and one-time romantic interest. She witnessed the first stages of the fall of Lordaeron during the Third War firsthand and,
            guided by a mysterious prophet later revealed as Medivh, Jaina rallied what survivors she could find and fled across the sea to Kalimdor.</p>
          <p>There, her expedition forces joined together with the night elves and the New Horde and defeated the Burning Legion during the Battle of Mount Hyjal.
            The human survivors then founded the port city of Theramore, joining the Alliance led by Varian Wrynn,
            while maintaining peace with the Horde for several years.</p>
          <p>Shortly after the fall of Deathwing, the Horde led by Garrosh Hellscream destroyed Theramore. Jaina managed to escape with her life,
             but the experience transformed her, making her more bellicose and even altering her appearance.
            Following the death of Rhonin during the attack, and fulfilling a prophecy made by the dragon-mage Korialstrasz,
            Jaina took the fallen mage's place as leader of the Kirin Tor and head of the Council of Six. In spite of personal tragedies,
            she attempted to maintain the Kirin Tor's neutrality during the Alliance-Horde war.
            After the Horde-aligned Sunreavers aided Garrosh to steal the Divine Bell,
            Jaina exiled the Sunreavers from her city during the Purge of Dalaran and aligned the Kirin Tor with the Alliance.
            Following the Battle for the Broken Shore, the Council decided unanimously to re-admit the Horde into Dalaran for the greater good.
            Furious, Jaina left the Kirin Tor.</p>

          <p>Following the War of the Thorns, Jaina returned to her homeland of Kul Tiras in the name of the
            Alliance but was imprisoned for treason by her mother at the suggestion of Lady Priscilla Ashvane.
            After Ashvane's own betrayal was discovered, Jaina reunited with her mother and brought the lost Kul Tiran fleet back home.
            Katherine stepped down as Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras and named Jaina in her stead.</p>
          <p>In the World of Warcraft RPG Jaina has several apperances and is a major character in many plotpoints. One of the most noteable might be her apperance as the
          final raidboss of The Battle for Dazar'alor for horde players.</p>
