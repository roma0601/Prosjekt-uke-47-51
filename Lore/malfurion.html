          <h2>Malfurion, Arch-Druid of the Moonglade</h2>
          <p>Malfurion Stormrage was the first mortal druid on Azeroth, and the night elf who initiated the mainstream use of druidism among
            the kaldorei people ten millennia ago under tutelage of the demigod Cenarius. He is the twin brother of Illidan Stormrage,
            as well as the loving and beloved husband of the high priestess of Elune, Tyrande Whisperwind.
            Together, the two have represented the highest leadership of the night elves ever since the fall of Queen Azshara and her Highborne caste.</p>
          <p>Through Malfurion's guidance, the night elves successfully halted the Burning Legion's first invasion of Azeroth
            during the legendary War of the Ancients. In its aftermath, he became the greatest of the world's archdruids.
            Malfurion and his druids slept to protect the Emerald Dream for 10,000 years to rebuild the world while his lover
            Tyrande was promoted to General of the Sentinels and would protect Kalimdor. Malfurion and Tyrande then led the night elves
            in the Third War, defeating the Burning Legion as they had done in ages past at the Battle of Mount Hyjal. He subsequently
            fell into a comatose state while in the Emerald Dream.</p>
            <p>After recovering in the wake of the Cataclysm, Malfurion and Tyrande were wed and now lead their people as one.
              Malfurion is often referred to as Shan'do, which means "honored teacher" in Darnassian.
              Connected deeply to the ebbs and flows of life on Azeroth and bearing ages of responsibility and wisdom,
              he is one of the mightiest and most venerated mortals of the Warcraft universe.</p>

          <h3>Apperance in the game</h3>
          <p>Malfurion is a major lore character and has had apperances in the RPG since Warcraft 3. He has had apperances in multiple raids,
            including The Emerald Nightmare in World of Warcraft: Legion, where he helped players fight their way to kill Xavius.
            He also appeares in the Dreamgrove as the orderhall leader of the druids.</p>
          <p>During the War of Thorns in the pre-patch to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, Malfurion almost defeated Sylvanas in one-on-one combat,
            but he was struck down by Saurfang who arrived at just the rigth time and landed a blow on him in the back. Sylvanas praised Saurfang and offered
            him the last blow, before she left, but Saurfang, feeling he had struck down Malfurion with an dishonorable blow decided to let him live.</p>
