            <h3>Uldir</h3>
            <p>Uldir was a titan research and quarantine facility where the titans conducted experiments on the Old Gods and dissected them to try to understand them. The titans' plan was to kill the Old Gods without ending their host: Azeroth. They ended up accidentally creating something that could potentially wipe out all life on the planet, a fifth Old God named G'huun. It was locked away within Uldir via three seals, each located within the pyramids of Atul'Aman, Nazwatha, and Dazar'alor. With the fall of the last seal, nothing now prevents G'huun from spreading his rot and decay across the world.</p>

            <h3>Battle of Dazar'alor</h3>
            <p>For ages untold, Dazar'alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan's life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari's bond to the Horde.</p>

            <h3>Eternal Palace</h3>
            <p>Ten thousand years ago, as the seas engulfed Zin-Azshari, Queen Azshara forged a dark bargain with N'Zoth that transformed her loyal subjects into the sinister naga. Through millennia of brutal conquest, Azshara has built a new empire from the ruins of the old and now holds dominion over the depths that once threatened to claim her. Ever the gracious host, she has invited the Alliance and Horde alike into her eternal palace to witness her glorious ascension... and their ultimate demise.</p>

            <p>Ny'alotha, the sleeping city, has awakened. For the first time in millennia, N'Zoth sits on his throne within the Black Empire. His armies flood from their dark halls, once again wreaking havoc on Azeroth. As the world shudders from these invasions, a desperate plan is hatched. Champions from the Horde and Alliance are gathered to face this ancient enemy within his own realm for one final confrontation that will decide the fate of the universe.</p>
