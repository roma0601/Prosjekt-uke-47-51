          <h2>Info</h2>
          <p>Since World of Warcraft was released in 2004 the game has gone through several massive changes, and the live version today, often called Retail WoW, is the result of all these changes.
          Every 2 years since the release there has been a new expansion added, and this year(2019) the 9th expansion was announced at the annual even called BlizzCon, and it is set to release some time in 2020, date yet to be decided.
        </p>
        <p>World of Warcraft is a MMO-RPG, a Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplay Game, where you play in a big open world filled with players from all over the world. Players create
        their own avatars, called characters, and get to custimize their look, choose their race, and their class. When you first play the game you start of at level 1,
        and as you complete quests and battle your way through dungeons you will level up, unlocking new abilities, and skills. Eventually you
        reach the max level, which currently is 120.</p>
        <p>At max level you can finally dive into the end game content; raids for 20-30 players, that come in both hard difficulties, which will require extreme amounts of coordination and preparation,
        and easier difficulties that can be completed by everyone with ease, 5-man mythic+ dungeons with scaling difficuly level, and pvp content, where you can group up with fellow players and
        slay champions of the opposing faction.</p>

          <h2>Classes</h2>
          <p>When you first download World of Warcraft you will have to select your race and class. First you will have to choose whether you want to be a healer, a tank or a damage dealer,
            often called a DPS. If you think you want to be a DPS you will also have to choose whether you want to be a ranged damage dealer, shooting your enemies with bolts and spells,
             or a melee damaged dealer beating the enemies with your powerful weapons and abilities.</p>
            <p>There is a wide variety of classes to pick from, so at first this task might seem grueling,
            but with a little bit of research the task becomes much easier.  </p>
