          <h2>Info</h2>
          <p>Since World of Warcraft was released in 2004 the game has gone through several massive changes, and the live version today, often called Retail WoW, is the result of all these changes.
          Every 2 years since the release there has been a new expansion added, and this year(2019) the 9th expansion was announced at the annual even called BlizzCon, and it is set to release some time in 2020, date yet to be decided.
        </p>
        <p>World of Warcraft is a MMO-RPG, a Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplay Game, where you play in a big open world filled with players from all over the world. Players create
        their own avatars, called characters, and get to custimize their look, choose their race, and their class. When you first play the game you start of at level 1,
        and as you complete quests and battle your way through dungeons you will level up, unlocking new abilities, and skills. Eventually you
        reach the max level, which currently is 120.</p>
        <p>At max level you can finally dive into the end game content; raids for 20-30 players, that come in both hard difficulties, which will require extreme amounts of coordination and preparation,
        and easier difficulties that can be completed by everyone with ease, 5-man mythic+ dungeons with scaling difficuly level, and pvp content, where you can group up with fellow players and
        slay champions of the opposing faction.</p>

          <h2>Classes</h2>
          <p>When you first download World of Warcraft you will have to select your race and class. First you will have to choose whether you want to be a healer, a tank or a damage dealer,
            often called a DPS. If you think you want to be a DPS you will also have to choose whether you want to be a ranged damage dealer, shooting your enemies with bolts and spells,
             or a melee damaged dealer beating the enemies with your powerful weapons and abilities.</p>
            <p>There is a wide variety of classes to pick from, so at first this task might seem grueling,
            but with a little bit of research the task becomes much easier.  </p>

              <h2>Raids</h2>
              <p>For many the end goal of World of Warcraft is to enter and complete the big raid instances. Each expansion new raids are added,
                and there are currently 4 avaiable difficulties for each new raid;
              </p>
              <p>
                LFR(Looking For Raid) is a feature that lets you queue for an easier version of the raid with some boss abilities removed
                and it automatically groups you up with other players that are also queueing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Normal lets you complete the raid with relative ease with a group of up to 30 players in a premade group, the bosses have all their intended
                abilities, but it still hardly poses a challenge to most players.
              </p>
              <p>
                Heroic starts to become a bit challenging, and usually requires some amount of skill and coordination. The damage and health of the bosses
                are ramped up and some new abilities that require more skill and precision are introduced. Completing this
                difficulty before the next raid tier awards the players with the feat of strenght called Ahead of the Curve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mythic is the hardest difficulty and therefore rewards the best loot. Damage and health is even higher, another ability is added, usually
                requiering high amounts of coordination. Therefore this difficulty should only be attempted by the most skilled players. Completing this
                difficulty before the next raid tier awards the players with the feat of strenght called Cutting Edge.
