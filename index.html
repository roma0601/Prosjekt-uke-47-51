            <h2>Phase 3</h2>
            <p>Phase 3 is the 2nd major content update for World of Waarcraft: Classic. The patch was released on December 10th 2019. The content update included
            important features such as PvP battlegrounds, which introduce a significant change in the Honor system, shifting the combat away from the open world
            and rather in specific PvP instances, a welcome change for many players. The raid "Blackwing Lair" also opens, allowing for the collection of new gear,
            and elementium ore, needed to craft the legendary weapon, "Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of The Windseeker".</p>
